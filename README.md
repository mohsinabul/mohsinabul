## Featured Projects

### [Smart Meter Load Forecasting with Lightweight Transformers](https://github.com/mohsinabul/Edge-Smart-Meter)  
Built and compared forecasting models (TinyFormer, LiteFormer, LiPFormer, LSTM) for smart meter data. Achieved 60% faster inference while maintaining accuracy. Integrated SHAP explainability and Docker-based edge deployment.  

### [Bank Transaction Fraud Detection](https://github.com/mohsinabul/Bank-Transaction-Fraud-Detection)  
Hybrid deep learning model (CNN + LSTM) applied on sequential transaction data. Achieved 90%+ recall, reducing undetected fraudulent cases.  

### [Sentiment Analysis on E-Commerce Reviews](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-MScDataScience-ATU/machine-learning-project-oisin-and-abul)  
Applied NLP with TF-IDF and classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes). Achieved 85% accuracy and built a sentiment dashboard.  

### [Customer CLV & Churn Prediction](https://github.com/mohsinabul/ecommerce-clv-churn-predictor)  
Used XGBoost with SMOTE and cohort analysis to improve churn recall to 84 percent, supporting customer retention strategies.  

### [Cancer Classification using ML](https://github.com/mohsinabul/Cancer-Classification-using-ML)  
Ensemble model combining SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression for cancer detection, improving robustness and accuracy.
